Description: xCell2 provides methods for cell type enrichment analysis using cell type signatures.
    It includes three main functions - 
    1. xCell2Train for training custom references objects from bulk or single-cell RNA-seq datasets.
    2. xCell2Analysis for conducting the cell type enrichment analysis using the custom reference.
    3. xCell2GetLineage for identifying dependencies between different cell types using ontology.
